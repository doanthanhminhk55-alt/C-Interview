Welcome to Questpond's youtube channel.
00:00:03.510
Today we are going to walkthrough 30 important.NET and C# interviewquestions. This is part
00:00:14.830
1 of the video series and in this whole videoseries we will go through some fundamental
00:00:19.759
C# interview questions. Fundamental meanslike CLR, Garbage Collecto, CTS, Stack, Heap,
00:00:26.749
Reference Type, Generic Collections, Multi-threading,Try catch block, deligates, events, difference
00:00:32.119
between abstract class and interfaces. Ifyou are not able to answer basic questions
00:00:42.420
what is stack and heap, boxing and unboxing,it is very rare that your interview will continue
00:00:48.560
for a long time or it will have any positiveresult. Please ensure the fundamental questions
00:00:55.379
should be right flowing from your head theanswer should come out very fluent. Also visit

email.
00:02:28.110
Let us get started with the first questionfrom our 30 questions.
00:02:33.310
Questions 1 - Explain the difference between.NET and C#. This questions won't be asked
00:02:42.190
directly by the interviewer. Interviewer won'tbe asking you explain me the difference between
00:02:48.150
.NET and C# but it is very much possible thatduring interview conversation or discussion
00:02:56.030
never ever get into a situation where yousay .NET and C# are one and the same thing.
00:03:03.640
It will create a negative dent in the interview.Here is the answer for it .NET is a framework
00:03:19.480
and C# is a programming language. When youtalk about C# it has those syntaxes, grammars,it
00:03:27.310
has those semantics, it has those for loops,it has those if conditions. So C# is a programming
00:03:38.930
language, it is Microsoft's flagship programminglanguage while .NET framework has two things
00:03:45.900
it is a collection of libraries and it hasruntime.
00:03:49.550
Let us first start with collection of libraries.In my solution explorer there is a framework.
00:03:56.230
You say that I want to use a collection inC# we can use a List and for that we have
00:04:09.000
to use this system.collection. This system.collectionis a readymade component or library. Right
00:04:19.639
click --> Properties and you can see hereit
00:04:34.520
is library. If you want to use XML and ifyou go to the path you will find system.xml.dll
00:04:51.120
. All these things what you saw now thesesystem.console, system.core, system.data are
00:05:05.990
all reusable libraries which belongs to .NETframework. Also .NET framework has one more
00:05:12.730
thing, it helps you to run your .NET applicationit has things called as CLR, garbage collector,
00:05:23.650
CTS, CLS when you run your .NET applicationthis is again the work of .NET framework,
00:05:32.370
it kicks off the CLR, compiles your applicationand makes your application running. Please
00:05:38.370
note there is a very big difference between.NET and C#, C# is a programming language
00:05:44.560
it has a syntaxes, semantics, grammars, sourcecodes while .NET framework is a collection
00:05:52.410
of libraries as well as it helps you to runyour .NET application or C# application. Using
00:06:00.289
both of them we create an application. Youwill use C# and you will invoke the .NET framework
00:06:10.150
libraries. From C# you will invoke .NET frameworklibrary. You can say I want to create a list
00:06:17.039
of a string. C# is programming language andit will invoke the .NET libraries and .NET
00:06:27.550
will also has a thing called as CLR to makeyour application running. In the interview
00:06:33.439
whenever you are talking with the intervieweralways send a message to him saying that yes
00:06:38.509
.NET is a framework and C# is a programminglanguage.
00:06:44.199
Differentiate between .NET framework vs .NETCore vs .NET 5.0.
00:06:51.139
Please note that when this question comesduring the interviews there are more than
00:06:57.139
10-15 differences which you can see highlightedout here but try to put down the first one
00:07:06.430
or two biggest difference between them. DOnot try to just start speaking all the 10-15
00:07:12.659
points it will look very very one sided. Thefirst thing which should really really come
00:07:18.620
out very strongly is .NET framework whichis old one which was created 18 years back
00:07:24.569
only works for Windows while the .NET coreis cross platform so it works on linux, mac,
00:07:35.169
windows as well and so on while .NET 5.0 isthe unification of both of them. You can say
00:07:42.150
that .NET 5.0 has all that good things whatwe did for past 18 years also it has those
00:07:49.689
new features which are coming in .NET core..NET 5.0 is more of a unified platform which
00:07:56.539
unifies not only the .NET core and .NET frameworkbut it unifies lot of other.NET runtimes.
00:08:02.419
Remember that there are lot of other .NETframeworks like Mono and something we made
00:08:06.520
for silverlight then we made somehting for.NET compact and so on. Basically .NET 5.0
00:08:15.949
unifies .NET framework, .NET core, .NET monoand so on because you get a common experience.
00:08:27.949
If you see what is happening now is if I wantto create a project in .NET framework then
00:08:38.100
I need to see I want to create project inconsole application .NET framework then I
00:08:48.320
have to choose .NET Core framework. I haveto make a choice this is not an unifies experience.
00:09:01.050
You have to choose saying I have to select.NET Core template, .NET framework template
00:09:07.960
and so on. The goal of .NET 5.0 is to providea unified experience, unified platform which
00:09:17.220
unites all the .NET runtimes around the worldone which is coming from Microsoft .NET framework,
00:09:25.100
.NET core, Mono and provide you unified experience.This is the first thing which should really
00:09:31.830
come out. .NET framework is classic one theone old one, it only works on Windows, .NET
00:09:39.770
Core works cross platform and .NET 5.0 isa unification platform which unifies all the
00:09:45.680
.NET framework into one umbrella giving youa unified and a common experience. The second
00:09:53.650
point which I feel you should talk with theinterviewer is performance. Performance of
00:09:59.820
.NET Core is better than .NET framework. Whatis the reason for it?
00:10:07.140
If you see .NET framework, I have these twoapplications ConsoleApp23 which is .NET Core
00:10:18.290
and ConsoleApp1 which is .NET. If you lookat the .NET framework e have big big DLLs
00:10:25.260
big big components like System, System.Dataand System.Data has Entity framework, System
00:10:33.450
has Collection as well as lot of things. Youcan see we have 1 to 8 that I can just count
00:10:39.350
it on my fingers. When I look at .NET Corethey have broken down to further like System.Collections,
00:10:47.890
if you want you can say System.Collection.Specialized..NET Core has taken big big DLLs of .NET framework
00:11:01.890
and they have broken down them into smallsmall peices. Because of this whenever the
00:11:07.950
components are loaded they are loaded onlywhat we need first thing, second the memory
00:11:14.890
footprint because of this becomes less becausewe are loading what we need and not loading
00:11:20.030
the unnecessary things. When memory footprintis less then definitely the performance becomes
00:11:28.660
better. .NET Core performance is better becausethey have divided big big DLLs into small
00:11:38.790
small pieces. You can say I want System.Collection.Concurrent, i don't want other things so it will only
00:11:46.420
give you concurrent and not the rest of things.In case of .NET framework it has this, stack
00:11:56.840
and so on but here they have broken down intopieces so this is the second thing I feel
00:12:03.740
which should come out when you are speakingthe differences. The last and the most important
00:12:09.450
one which i will speak from all of these 10points is CLI Support. In case of .NET Core
00:12:23.300
you can fire commands through the commandlinefor example you can see this .NET core application.
00:12:31.040
I can go to the command line and fire frommy command line dotnet build , dotnet run
00:12:47.310
, what happens when you can fire things throughcommand line what is the advantage of firing
00:13:04.310
through command line is that I can integratewith any IDE , I can even code in a simple
00:13:10.690
notepad but when it comes to .NET frameworkyou don't have too many choices you have to
00:13:15.561
literally go through only visual studio, gothrough that templates if you want to create
00:13:20.250
a project. Here, to create a project you needto do dotnet new console and it creates a
00:13:30.440
console application. At this moment yes Ialready have a template, you can create and
00:13:41.690
run project just through the command lineand that makes .NET core more attractive because
00:13:48.950
it has a CLI support and .NET 5.0 is the unificationof all the .NET runtimes. Firt thing when
00:13:58.690
this question comes before you in the interviewthere are 10 differences as i have already
00:14:03.200
said but I would say that speak one, two orthree differences and put before the interviewe.
00:14:09.291
Interviewer asks you further tell me if Iwnat to develop microservice is .NET framework
00:14:16.660
good or .NET core? Must then be you cna talkabout other difference. If he asks you is
00:14:22.750
packaging better in .NET framework or .NETcore? Yes in .NET core because here it is
00:14:29.350
more modular, more smaller in pieces you canplug them together but here it is like one
00:14:35.050
big framework makes things difficult. Threebig differences Cross Platform, Performance
00:14:43.310
is better in caseof .NET core and CLI tools..NET 5.0 , you can't really talk about the
00:14:50.650
difference because it is an unified platform,it unifies all the dotnet runtimes one which
00:14:56.280
is of Microsoft as well as which come fromthe community like mono and other things.
00:15:02.620
The next thing is because of that you havea common experience or unified experience.
00:15:07.720
Question 3 - What is IL code and Questions4 - Why do we need JIt?
00:15:12.870
Let me answer both of these questions in onego because both of these questions have a
00:15:19.120
very very deep connection. First thing whenyou say your C# code has to run inside a computer
00:15:27.300
it has to be converted to an assembly languageor it has to be converted to machine code
00:15:34.480
or converted to a machine language.This codeof your C# if it has to run inside a computer
00:15:48.570
it has to get converted to Assembly or somethingwhich the machine understands. This is your
00:15:57.500
higher level language you can say. When thecompiler compiles it has to get converted
00:16:03.550
into this machine language but what C# compilerdoes is, it does not directly convert this
00:16:10.310
into the machine language it first convertsit into a partially compiled code called as
00:16:15.740
IL Code or Intermediate Language code. ILstands for Intermediate Language code and
00:16:24.780
it is a partially compiled code and laterwhen you run your program when you say now
00:16:29.810
I wnat to run my program and execute my programat that time we have somebody called as the
00:16:35.510
JIT. This JIT which stands for Just In Timecompiler runs over this IL code and compiles
00:16:42.880
it into the machine language. IL code is anintermediate language code it is a partially
00:16:52.430
compiled code. JIT stands for Just In Timecompiler and JIT compiles IL code into machine
00:17:02.300
language.
00:17:03.300
Question 5 - Is it possible to see this codeIL code visually? yes it is possible to see
00:17:09.470
this IL code visually by using Disassemblerslike ILDSM or ILSpy. For example you can see
00:17:19.789
here this is my compile code which is a DLL(Dynamic Link Library) to see this i will
00:17:28.050
run ILDSM which is a Disassembler which comeswith the visual studio command prompt. Over
00:17:36.499
here I can see this add method out here whichactually adds two numbers. If I go here I
00:17:46.200
can see that this is the code, it does addition of the two numbers
00:18:00.860
arg1 and arg2. It is possible to see the ILcodde visually by using disassemblers like
00:18:11.620
ILDSM or ILSpy.
00:18:14.070
Question 6 - What is the benefit of compilingin to IL code or why do you want to compile
00:18:22.470
into an IL code?Here what the interviewer want to ask is that
00:18:28.860
this C# code why do we have to compile itto Inteemdiate language like IL Code why can't
00:18:36.840
just like C or C++ compilers wherein directlythey go and compile into a machine language
00:18:43.129
and assembly language? Why can't we do thesame with .NET and C#? The reason for this
00:18:51.470
is difference between the development environmentand the runtime environment. This is your
00:18:58.720
C# code let us say the developer is usingwindows 10 he is using 65 bit machine and
00:19:09.029
so on. But the runtime environment can beWindows 8, it can be Windows XP or Windows
00:19:23.789
7 and nowadays with .NET core this can beLinux as well. The runtime environment can
00:19:31.419
be very very different. This is your dev environmentthe developers' machine which can have a different
00:19:37.899
environment, different operating systems becauseof that .NET compiles it into IL code and
00:19:49.360
then depending on what is your OS it sayswhat is the ebst code for Windows 8, what
00:20:00.899
can be the best code which can be generatedfor Windows XP or the best best compilation
00:20:05.000
I mean and for Linux and so on. That's whywe have an IL code to put things together.
00:20:15.750
The runtime environment and development environmentcan be different so that's why we compile
00:20:21.710
into IL Code then depending on what kind ofenvironment it is JIT generates or compiles
00:20:27.929
an optimal code as per that runtime and asper that operating system or hardware of that
00:20:35.559
execution enviroment.
00:20:37.049
Question 7 - Does .NET support multiple programminglanguages?
00:20:44.610
Here interviewer is asking that can I writemy code only in C# or there are other languages
00:20:51.590
which .NET framework supports? .NET frameworksupports many other languages for example
00:20:56.789
you can create a new project, you can writeyour code in C#, you can write your code in
00:21:03.240
VB.NET, you can write your code in F#(onemore language) and we have other ones like
00:21:12.840
C++, .NET and so on. Remember that .NET frameworksupports multiple languages like VB.NET, C#,
00:21:22.090
C++, .NET, F# and so on but the end of theday either you coding C# either you coding
00:21:31.690
VB.NETor visual basic at the end of the dayit will get compiled to IL Code. It does not
00:21:37.179
matter what is your programming language.The whole point of creating this programming
00:21:49.610
environment for developers is that some developerslike C# becase it is case sensitive, it has
00:21:57.600
those curly brackets.
00:21:59.000
If you are a developer who likes
00:22:12.869
to code in this curly brackets who likes thingsto be case sensitive then C# is for you. If
00:22:19.900
you are a person who have started career invisual basic 4 and visual basic 6 and you
00:22:24.910
like this verbous code, you don't want casesensitiveness then go for VB.NET. The .NET
00:22:32.179
framework supports multiple programming languagesbut at the end of the day it gets compiled
00:22:37.619
to IL Code. The answer here is yes .NET frameworksupports multiple programming languages. Finally
00:22:46.179
if you start executing it compiles to IL code.
00:22:50.090
Question 8 - Explain the importance of CLR?CLR stands for Common Language Runtime. It
00:23:01.400
is a runtime execution environment of .NET.CLR helps to execute your .NET application.
00:23:08.669
There are two primary things the CLR doesfirst it converts your IL code to native language
00:23:17.220
or to machine language. This is the firstwork of CLR. Second this native language what
00:23:25.539
is the code it executes it runs the applicationand when the application runs any kind of
00:23:33.580
unused memory of the application is consumedby garbage collector. CLR is also responsible
00:23:41.750
for garbage collector. CLR primarily doeslot of things but here for the interview I
00:23:51.840
am higlighting two important things one isit converts your IL code to Native language,
00:23:58.049
second it runs your application and when yourapplication runs if there is any kind of unused
00:24:03.580
memory that is claimed by this garbage collectorso running of the garbage collector is also
00:24:08.369
part of CLR.
00:24:09.370
Question 9 - What is the different betweenmanaged code and unmanaged code?
00:24:15.080
Code that executes under the environment ofCLR is called as a manage code. All the code
00:24:24.259
what we write in C# or we write in VB.NETwhich gets converted into IL code is all managed
00:24:29.799
code because the CLR compiles it to the nativelanguage the garbage collector collects when
00:24:35.399
the objects are not used. The code which runsunder the umbrella or under the control of
00:24:42.989
CLR environment is a managed code. For examplethis Customer x = new Customer (); this static
00:24:48.529
void manin, class program are managed code.Code which does not run under the control
00:24:55.429
of CLR execution for example C++ code, VC++or VB6 code. In this code you can see I am
00:25:04.179
importing a user32.dll this user32.dll isprobably is C, C++ or VC++ they have their
00:25:13.340
own compilers and own runtimes CLR does notcontrol them. These kind of code are Managed
00:25:20.960
code. In this program when I run this programit will popup a message box but that message
00:25:27.970
box whatever is coming out here is comingfrom some other C++or VC++ or C kind of a
00:25:38.860
code. This console application is all .NETbut you can see
00:25:49.470
this message box here hello world that's notcoming from C# it is coming from the user32.dll
00:25:57.739
which is probably written in some other languageso managed codes are those codes which run
00:26:03.399
under the control of the CLR execution environmentand unmanaged codes are those codes which
00:26:08.809
run outside the CLR execution environmentlike C++, VC++, VB6 and they have their own
00:26:15.860
compilers they have their own runtimes theyhave their own way of doing the memory allocation.
00:26:20.600
Questions 10 - Explain the importance of GarbageCollector?
00:26:26.129
Garbage collector is a background processrunning continuously and claim any kind of
00:26:31.619
unused managed resources. I stress is thistwo words Unused Managed resources. If there
00:26:41.690
is any unused managed resources while your.NET program is running, Garbage COllector
00:26:45.191
comes now and then and starts cleaning themup. Here, I have a very simple program which
00:26:52.080
is a for loop running for a very long period.This is creating customers and then disposing
00:26:59.340
them and new fresh customers get created,customer objects are getting created. Now
00:27:08.159
garbage collector will come after some timeundermistic time it will come and it will
00:27:14.669
clean these objects. We can see this in theprofiler and this profiler will help us to
00:27:29.980
show when the garnage collector runs. Youcan see first the memory was rising like new
00:27:38.489
customer objects were getting created butafter that garbage collector is running. Now
00:27:49.600
the memory is flat so the objects are gettingcreated and objects are getting collected.
00:27:57.539
Garbage collector is a background processwhich keeps running continuously and claims
00:28:06.929
any kind of unused managed resources.
00:28:10.570
Question 11: - Can garbage collector claimunmanaged objects?
00:28:15.809
Unmanaged resources means objects which aregetting created by C++ or objects which are
00:28:21.940
created by some other programming language,the answer is NO.
00:28:26.380
Grabage collector cannot collect objects whichare created outside CLR runtime.
00:28:32.909
Question 12 :- Explain the importance of CTS?CTS stands for Common Type System. .NET is
00:28:43.039
a framework and it supports many programminglanguages you can invoke the .NET library
00:28:48.790
using C#, you can invoke the .NET libraryusing VB.NET, F# VC++ .NET. There are many
00:28:59.080
programming languages which can compile toIL Code. But each one of these programming
00:29:04.950
languages when they define their data typethey have their own way of doing it. For example
00:29:09.899
you can see on the screen I've C# out herein C# when we define a data type we say int
00:29:15.480
i = 0; and in VB.NET Dim i as Integer andin VC++ we can see other way of doing it or
00:29:26.880
in F# we have some other way of declaringthe data types. Suppose that I want to use
00:29:34.820
this VB.NET code inside C# then how do I goabout it? There should be some common platform
00:29:41.269
because the data types are so different ofeach languages. What the .NET compiler does
00:29:47.139
is or when the compiler is compiling the codeit compiles them into a common type system.
00:29:53.100
It says your VB.NET says Dim i as integerC# says i. Both of them get compiled into
00:30:02.320
a common type system which is int 32. In thesame way for other data types if you have
00:30:08.840
string, char, double , decimal so common typesystem ensures whichever language you coding
00:30:19.370
your data types will get mapped to a Commondata type of the .NET framework.
00:30:25.190
Questions 13 :- Explain the importance ofCLS?
00:30:29.149
CLS stands for Common Language Specification.NET supports multiple programming languages.
00:30:37.999
These programming lnaguages are differentin terms of data types and behavior so the
00:30:43.350
data types difference is handled by CommonType System but the behavior also of the languages
00:30:49.830
are different. C# is case sensitive so inC# if you say int i = 0; and int I = 0; both
00:31:02.739
of them are different they are different variables.But in case of VB.NET it is not case sensitive,
00:31:10.890
if you say Dim i as integer and Dim I as Integeryou can't have like this in VB.NET, you will
00:31:22.029
be getting an error. If you write C# codelike this where ther is small i and capital
00:31:28.729
I how can VB.NET understand it because itdoes not understand case sensitiveness. It
00:31:35.749
says for me i is i whether capital I or SmallI. Some languages is case sensitive and some
00:31:45.691
language is not case sensitive, some languageis functional some language is not functional,
00:31:51.409
some languages uses pointers some other languagedon't use pointers if they start using their
00:31:56.909
own custom behavior which is not existingin other languages it will become very difficult
00:32:02.460
to have cross interoperability. In other wordsif I want to consume C# code inside VB.NET
00:32:10.389
it would be difficult so the common languagespecification is set of guidelines which says
00:32:16.749
guideline no.1 dont use case sensitiveness,guideline no. 2 don't use pointers, guideline
00:32:23.229
no. 3 and guideline no. 4. If you follow thoseguidelines then inside your .NET environment
00:32:29.500
you can easily consume a VB.NET code insideC#, you can consume F# code inside C# and
00:32:36.779
C# code inside F#. You can have cross interoperabilitybetween the languages. I repeat, common language
00:32:44.559
specification is set of guidelines if thatis followed then the languages the code what
00:32:53.690
you write in different languages can resusevery easily while common type system which
00:33:01.229
we discussed prviously is nothing but whenthe data types of the languages are different.
00:33:06.389
So common type system more deals with datatypes saying Dim i as Integer and int i let
00:33:13.340
me bring them into a common platform . CLSdeals with different behaviors of the language
00:33:19.979
while CTS deals with the data types.
00:33:22.789
Question 14 :- Explain the difference betweenStack and Heap?
00:33:27.900
Stack and Heap are memory types inside .NETapplication. When your .NET application runs
00:33:32.860
ther are two memory types one is a stack andanother one is a heap. On stack premitive
00:33:42.609
data types are allocated means data typeslike integer, boolean, double, decimal. These
00:33:49.010
data types get allocated on the stack andon the stack the variable and the value both
00:33:59.570
are stored at the same place. For exampleyou can see the first statement int i = 10;
00:34:05.419
so here i will be stored in this locationand also the value 10 will be stoed in the
00:34:10.730
same location, second one boolean b in stackit goes like one above another. Here also
00:34:18.949
this is b will get stored here. The memorylocation is same where the value is so the
00:34:25.809
value true is also stored in the same memorylocation. In case of stack the variable, the
00:34:35.089
data and the memory location all are at oneplace. Look at the third thing here this is
00:34:40.418
an object, we are creating a customer objectwith the value Shiv in it. In this case the
00:34:46.909
x will be allocated here but the value willbe stored in the heap. This value whatever
00:34:55.949
you have here name = shiv will be stored inthe heap. In x only a pointer will be there,
00:35:04.119
there will be a pointer here and that pointerwill point towards the actual customer object
00:35:09.230
x. In heap objects are stored, on stack premitivedata types like integer, boolean and other
00:35:19.460
things are stored. Stack stores primitivedata types while heap stores objects.
00:35:26.320
Questions 15 :- What are Value types & Referencetypes?
00:35:31.310
Value types are those types which are storedon the stack and the value and the pointer
00:35:36.670
means the memory location both are storedat the same place. This int i = 10 the memory
00:35:47.289
location and the value they are both storedat the same place. Reference types are those
00:35:55.849
types wherein the pointer is stored on thestack but the actual data is stored on the
00:36:02.430
Heap. So there is a reference out here. Inreference type the memory pointer is stored
00:36:09.260
on the stack but the actual data like valueShiv stored on the Heap.
00:36:14.090
Value types are stored on stack while referencetypes are stored on heap. Value types are
00:36:15.860
your normal data types like int, bool, doubleand reference types are all objects.
00:36:17.410
Question 16 : - Explain boxing and unboxing?
00:36:20.780
Boxing is nothing but it is when your datamoves from a value type to a reference type.
00:36:29.730
In this code we have int i = 10 which is avalue type because it is allocated on a stack.
00:36:36.380
We have obje y , now we are trying to movethis value i to y this is termed as boxing.
00:36:43.930
When you are moving value type to a referencetype is termed as boxing. When you are moving
00:36:49.590
from reference type to value type is termedas Unboxing. The next line out here is unboxing
00:36:56.410
because you are trying to move from a referencetype to a value type.
00:37:01.540
The next connected questions to boxing andunboxing which normally the interviewer can
00:37:06.770
ask you is that what is the consequence ofBoxing and Unboxing.
00:37:11.930
The consequence of boxing and unboxing isperformance because now your data is jumping
00:37:18.690
from value type to a reference type, it isjumping from stack memory to heap then you
00:37:24.900
are jumping from heap to a stack. If you aredoing this more and often definitely you will
00:37:30.180
have a performance implication.
00:37:32.069
Question 18 :- Explain casting, implicit castingand explicit casting?
00:37:38.819
First let us try to understand what is casting.Casting means you are trying to move from
00:37:44.470
one data type to another data type. For exampleyou can see this is integer i here and you
00:37:50.119
are trying to move from integer to a doubledata type, this is termed as Casting. If casting
00:37:58.560
is happening automatically means you don'thave to do anything then it is termed as implicit
00:38:02.890
casting. You can see over here I don't haveto do anything I have to just say i = d and
00:38:09.640
the value will move integer to the double.When you are moving from a lower data type
00:38:17.170
to an higher data type you will normally haveimplicit casting like when you are trying
00:38:21.880
move from integer to a double int is a lowerdata type and double is higher data type this
00:38:27.710
is termed as implicit casting. If you wantto move from double to int it is showing me
00:38:46.299
an exception. It is saying I cannot cast thisautomatically you need an explicit, here i
00:38:55.880
have to say (int) this is termed as explicitcasting. Casting means you are trying to move
00:39:06.799
from one data type to another data type. Implicitcasting means you do not have to do anything
00:39:11.420
special the value just moves from one datatype to another data type while explicit casting
00:39:18.440
means you are trying to move from a higherdata type to lower data type and you need
00:39:23.119
to specify the data type before the variablename like this.
00:39:27.369
Question 19 :- What can happen during explicitcasting?
00:39:28.805
What is the consequences of explicit casting,the consequence of explicit casting can be
00:39:33.500
data loss. In this case because there is nodata loss C# just allows you to do the casting
00:39:41.950
but in this case you can have a data lossbecause integer does not support decimals.
00:39:48.170
Here we will have a data loss that's why toalert you it is telling that hey do you want
00:39:56.980
to really loose decimal part of it, I'll sayyes I want to loose decimal pasrt of it I
00:40:01.960
understand what I am doing. Explicit castingis like a warning saying you are going to
00:40:07.800
have a loss of data type are you sure aboutthis. If I run this program you will see in
00:40:14.660
the y i will not see the decimal part of it.You can see this is d and this is y d is 100.23
00:40:31.900
which is into d1 now from d1 when I move toy you can see it has removed the decimal so
00:40:41.050
here we have data loss. In explicit castingthere is a possibility of data loss and we
00:40:46.260
should be careful of about it.
00:40:49.240
Question 20 :- Array VS ArrayList.
00:40:54.369
An array is a fixed length size. This is thearray here having 3 elements so it is fixed
00:41:06.300
length size. You can resize the array butit is quite of a ceremony for example I can
00:41:12.849
say array.resize , resize method again belongto an array then I have to pass in myarray.
00:41:22.780
It is quite tideous to resize an array becausethe whole goal of array was is fixed length.
00:41:32.280
Array is fixed length that is one part secondit is strongly type in other words this array
00:41:38.059
is very specific type of interger that meansin the marray i cannot push here string. here
00:41:51.309
I am trying to push a string it is not allowed.Array are fixed size or length and they are
00:42:00.240
strongly typed. When it comes to array listit is flexible in terms of number of elements.
00:42:08.119
I can say here mylist.Add(1); mylist.Add(2);and I can say mylist.Add("Shiv");
00:42:19.579
First is the size is flexible when it comesto arraylist the second important thing is
00:42:40.390
it is not strongly typed. Down below I can add number, string then I can
00:42:54.360
add a boolean, add an object. The differencebetween Array and ArrayList is Array is fixed
00:43:03.049
size, ArrayListis flexible in terms of size.Array is strong typed while arraylist is not
00:43:10.300
strongly type. After this definitelly a connectedquestion which will come is in terms of performance
00:43:17.869
is arraylist is better or array?
00:43:19.140
Question 21 :- Whose performance is betterArray or ArrayList?
00:43:20.980
When it comes to performance definitely arrayis better because it is strongly type. If
00:43:26.340
you look at ArrayList I can add a number,string, boolean and so on that means I can
00:43:33.289
add anything in my arraylist so this leadsto boxing and unboxing. When I am adding value
00:43:43.030
1 out here that means I am moving from a valuetype to a reference type. In this mylist.Add
00:43:52.650
this add is taking an object. Basically Iam moving from value type to a reference type
00:43:58.059
that leads to boxing and unboxing, becauseof that the performance of arraylist is not
00:44:05.640
good in comparison with array but arraylisthas flexibility but that comes as a cost the
00:44:15.680
performance is comparitively slower when itcomes to array because of boxing and unboxing.
00:44:21.200
Question 22 :- What are generic collections?Generic collections takes all the good things
00:44:28.420
of array and takes all the good things ofarraylist it is flexible. In a generic collection
00:44:41.270
I can say List geneint = new List();this is a generic collection. Firstit is
00:44:57.520
strongly typed so if I do an add you can seethis is pure integer collection. I cannot
00:45:05.819
add a string out here that means all thatboxing and unboxing all has gone off. You
00:45:16.400
cannot covert int to a string. Second is Ican add any number of elements so it is flexible.
00:45:23.880
A generic collection is strongly typed andalso in terms of size it is flexible so when
00:45:34.700
it comes to using collections in .NET thefavorites for everyone is a generic collection.
00:45:43.609
You can see this is the list of int and inthe same way I can create a list of boolean.
00:45:54.510
Now this generic collection becomes a stronglytyped boolean collection so a generic collection
00:46:04.440
is strongly typed also the size is flexible.It takes all good things of the array that
00:46:10.059
means it takes a strong typness of the arrayand it takes the flexibility of the arraylist
00:46:15.160
and when it comes to .NET this is the mostused type of collection.
00:46:19.950
Question 23 :- What are Threads(Multithreading)in C#? Or How to implement Multithreading
00:46:25.670
in C#?
00:46:27.370
Multithreading or Threads in C# helps youto execute code parallely. If you want to
00:46:35.289
do paralle execution of your code then youneed to use Thread. You can see in my code
00:46:41.130
out here we have Method1 and Method2. If Iwant to execute both of these Methods parallely
00:46:47.640
then I need to create a thread. I am creatinga new Thread (Method1) and t1 Method2 then
00:46:58.020
t.Start(); and t1.Start(); With this whathappens is both of these Methods will run
00:47:03.680
parallely and to implement threading we needto use Namespace System.Threading. If I run
00:47:12.420
this code out here it will run Method 1 sometimesand Method2 sometimes. If you want to implement
00:47:24.859
parallel execution or if you want to run yourcode parallely then you need to use Threads.
00:47:33.500
Question 24 :- What's the difference betweenThreads and TPL?
00:47:45.089
In .NET 4.x there was something released wascalled as TPL (Task Parallel Library). You
00:47:51.640
can achieve the same thing what you can achieveby Threads. The same code which I have written
00:47:56.529
here I can use task like this.
00:48:02.329
And this code will also run parallely. Theinterviewer is trying to understand what's
00:48:08.920
the difference between using a Thread andusing TPL. Before I answer this question I
00:48:18.170
want to share a very important tip. In C#interviews , in .NET interviews or any interview
00:48:28.299
always answer to the point. When you get suchquesitons like explain the difference between
00:48:34.390
this and that always answer important thingsfirst. Do not hit around the bush. Interviewers
00:48:44.501
are mostly seniors they are already stressedin projects they not get paid extra for interviews.
00:48:51.540
On the top of it if he get some candidateswho is taking him around it is not going to
00:48:57.840
help. In case of threads vs task if you tellhim TPL has async and await must be it will
00:49:06.660
not convince him. Let us try to answer theimportant points first when it comes to differences.
00:49:14.119
The first big difference between Thread andTask is that Task does parallel processing
00:49:20.640
the name itself for task or TPL is Task ParallelLibrary. It actually does parallel processing
00:49:28.890
means what? If you spontan threads. Let'ssay you have four processors in your computer
00:49:36.880
still all the ten threads have a processoraffinity a CPU affinity so they try to run
00:49:42.869
only on processor1 or processor2. If you wantto utilize your other processors then you
00:49:51.090
need to write some code like this to get thecurrent processs you need to say p.ProcessorAffinity
00:49:57.769
run on second processor or on the third processor.Itis quite a big work so when you use task the
00:50:08.410
TPL library looks at your processors and sayswhich of the processors are not loaded and
00:50:15.019
runs those parallel code or parallel logicinto the processor. TPL actually utilizes
00:50:23.200
your processors it actually does parallelprocessing while threads have a processor
00:50:30.990
affinity they try to stick to a processornot really doing parallel processing but rather
00:50:37.720
than doing context switching or time slicing.
00:50:40.849
The first point which should come out in thisdifference is that task utilizes your processors
00:50:49.510
it utilizes your hardware properties. We don'thave to write extra code for it while threads
00:50:55.369
have a CPU affinity and the third P is incase of task I can return a result in case
00:51:04.460
of thread I can't. To get result from a threadI will use delegates, events and so on. I
00:51:11.750
can capture a task, change task, wait forthe other task to finish, I can use async
00:51:17.920
and await. TPL is a wrapper or it is an abstractionwhich is over threads and it provides lot
00:51:33.470
of things. First one it provides Prallel processingsecond one it provides Pooling rather than
00:51:39.510
building from scratch the objects are takenfrom the pool and then lot of plus lot of
00:51:44.960
extra things it has it can return a resultfrom a parallel process you can chain a task,
00:51:53.250
wait for a task to finish, you can use asyncand await and so on. When you go before the
00:52:01.059
interviewer when you are asked such kind ofquestions prepare your oneliners, speak to
00:52:06.850
the point make your answers crisp and clear.One of the things during the TPL and thread
00:52:15.349
conversation I would surely send to the intervieweris that in today's age I will always use TPL
00:52:24.059
because TPL is a wrapper on the threads providingall these features so why would I ever use
00:52:28.670
threads. In case I have legacy code in .NET2.0 or 3.0 it make sense to use threads but
00:52:35.539
if you talk about .NET core or if you talkabout .NET 4.x any version we would just use
00:52:42.030
TPL and not the old threads.
00:52:45.220
Question 25 :- How are exceptions handledin C#?
00:52:52.700
Exceptions are handled by using the try/catchblocks. I have a very simple code in this
00:52:57.980
simple code at this line we are going to getan infinite exception or divide by zero exception.
00:53:07.069
In whichever places you will get an exceptionyou will wrap that place with try block. I
00:53:13.760
am expecting in these two lines i can haveerror I have wrapped them into try block and
00:53:21.940
now if any exception happens it will jumpto the catch block. In the catch block I can
00:53:31.400
decide what to do when this error happens.Here I will say if exception happens then
00:53:37.460
just show Divide by zero error, renter thevalue. Exceptions are handled by using try
00:53:49.740
catch block. If I run this
00:54:02.049
my application has handled exception gracefully.If you do not have a try catch block it just
00:54:14.160
throws up the exception and it leaves it tothe application to handle it. if the exceptions
00:54:23.119
are not handled the application just crasheslike this. Exception are handled by using
00:54:28.490
the try catch block. Another conencted questionwhich comes over here is what is the use of
00:54:38.020
the finally block?
00:54:39.190
Question 26 :- What is the need of finallyblock?
00:54:43.980
Finally block is a place where you write thecode which would execute irrespective you
00:54:51.921
have an exception or you do not have an exception.In the finally block you want to write some
00:54:58.359
clean up code , some memory and so on. Youcan write that in the finally block. Irrespective
00:55:10.921
you have an exception or you do not have anexception this code will always execute. If
00:55:16.641
I run this now you will see I get Divide byzero error but also the clean up code runs.
00:55:26.040
If I don't even have an exception then alsomy finally block will run. You can see I don't
00:55:35.130
have the exception, it has not gone to thecatch block but the clean up code still runs.
00:55:41.269
In finally block we put that code which willrun irrespective if there is an error or if
00:55:47.670
there is no error.
00:55:48.670
Question 27 :- Why do we need the Out keyword?What is the use of out keyword in C#?
00:55:59.170
When you write a c# functions it returns onlyone value. But what if you want to return
00:56:06.900
multiple value? In this case you want to returnan addition, multiplication, division you
00:56:17.140
want multiple return values then you willuse the our keyword. Here I can create an
00:56:24.759
out which is an addition, an out which issubtraction and so on. I can say here add
00:56:43.579
= num1 + num2; I don't need return type meansthe output will be sent in these variables
00:56:51.170
then I will say sub = num1 - num2; then onthe caller side we can say this will have
00:57:03.450
the value of subtraction and then we can invokethe MyMaths function and we can say whatever
00:57:11.520
is the calculated value in this add and subplease send it back to add here and please
00:57:19.099
send it back to sub here. I can return multiplevalues from a function. The whole goal of
00:57:26.710
the Out keyword is to return multiple valuesfrom a function.
00:57:31.559
A very big congratulations you have completed27 questions. We have more 3 questions to
00:57:41.960
go. This video has already become more thanan hour, I will go through these three questions
00:57:50.329
theoritically in this part 1 and in part 2I will show you the code demonstrations. These
00:57:58.060
are three questions which are flashed on thescreen. Let us go through the answers of them
00:58:04.759
and in the next video i.e. part 2 we willsee the demonstration of it.
00:58:10.799
Quesiton 28 :- What is the need of Delegates?
00:58:14.559
Any C# interview does not get completed witha question on delegates and events. Here is
00:58:22.380
the answer - Delegate is a pointer to functionand it is very useful when you talk about
00:58:27.300
communicating between threads. If you havea multi-threaded environment and if you want
00:58:33.109
to communicate between those threads thendeligate is a way to go ahead. Delegate is
00:58:38.720
a call back it is a pointer to a functionto communicate between threads.
00:58:45.240
Question 29 :- What are events?Events are wrapper over delegates, they are
00:58:52.509
encapsulation over delegates. They ensuredelegates cannot be tempered by anyone. Events
00:59:00.029
change the delegates to a publisher subscriber model.
00:59:12.920
Now in part 2 I will show you in practicalway why the answer is like this. To my best
00:59:26.230
understanding when you see something practicallyyou grasp mush better. In part 2 we will be
00:59:31.430
going 28, 29 and 30 again.
00:59:34.670
Question 30 :- Whats the difference betweenAbstract Class and Interface?
00:59:38.890
Abstract class is a half defined parent classso it comes inheritance. If you have many
00:59:45.579
classes and have any common between them thenprobably it is good to go and create an abstract
00:59:51.349
class, parent class and put the common functionalitiesinto the parent class while interface is a
00:59:59.319
contract and it has to be implement. Interfacekind of forces a structure into a class. This
01:00:10.260
is what these three questions are. What isthe need of delegates? It is a call back,
01:00:15.140
a pointer to a function. What are events?Events are encapsulation over delegates what's
01:00:19.740
the difference between abstract class andinterface. Abstract class is a half defined
01:00:24.930
parent class while interface is a contract.
01:00:28.789
Before we wrap up this one hour of trainingvideo I would like to quickly go through three
01:00:36.029
tips, these tips will keep increasing so aswe do part 2, part 3. There are like 10 tips
01:00:41.599
which I'll be sharing with you gradually.Now in these 3 tips first two tips I've already
01:00:48.450
discussed in the previous part of the videobut i'll just iterate over here.
01:00:51.519
Tip no. 1 - Do not hit around the bush answerto the point. The interviewer does not have
01:00:58.900
time to listen your whole Saga and Raga. Justanswer to the point.
01:01:05.000
Second tip - First thing first, if somebodyasking what is the difference between .NET
01:01:11.569
core and .NET framework do not start saying.NET framework is old one and .NET core is
01:01:15.789
new one. .NET core runs cross platform and.NET framework runs only on windows. Say the
01:01:23.750
important points first, do not waste interviewerstime.
01:01:28.049
And tip no. 3 - Use right technical vocubulary,impress the interviewer by using polished
01:01:36.160
and proper right technical vocabulary. Ifsomebody ask you a question over events. Someone
01:01:44.099
can say events are wrapper over delegates.Good answer right answer but not polished
01:01:51.200
but if somebody says events are encapsulationover delegates. Events create a publisher
01:01:58.319
subscriber model. English is my second laguagebut just because I know the technical vocabulary
01:02:09.789
I can impress the interviewer. Events areencapsulation over delegates and events helps
01:02:15.829
you to create a publisher subscriber kindof an environment. have the right technical
01:02:21.349
vocabulary. What is delegate? A pointer toa function, callbacks. Interface is a contract.
01:02:31.440
These are technical vocabularies which spiceup your answer. Hope that you will remember
01:02:38.390
these three tips out there.
01:02:41.369
That brings us to the end of our 30 questions.As discussed we have covered all 30 questions
01:02:48.170
in this video. Very quickly the last threequestions that is regarding the delegates
01:02:54.859
, regarding the events and the abstract classand interface I did not go too much in debth.
01:02:59.900
I just went through some answers but did notshow a demo. We are going to have now more
01:03:08.400
parts of C# interview question. These aremore advanced series and these series are
01:03:12.240
all available on questpond.com , in the part2 I'll be demonstrating what is a delegate?
01:03:18.779
what is an event? In what sitation we shoulduse a delegate. What is the difference between
01:03:23.410
delegates and events then I will also talkabout abstract class and interfaces. The part
01:03:28.940
2 of the series will cover events and delegates.
01:03:34.480
Happy job hunting, Thank You! Happy Learning!
